                    I build to learn. I'm drawn to hard problems, clean systems, and tools that 
                    teach me something new. What matters most is understanding how things work 
                    and pushing into areas I haven't explored before.

                    <p>
                        I'm a Computer Engineering student at the University of Toronto with a 3.9 GPA, 
                        specializing in AI and web development. I build intelligent web applications 
                        that combine full-stack development with applied machine learning. My work spans 
                        a range of technical areasâ€”from conversational voice agents using Twilio and 
                        LangGraph, to health-focused AI tools and custom backend systems powered by 
                        Python, FastAPI, and cloud infrastructure.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'm also the founder / CTO of TrainerIQ, an AI-enhanced coaching platform supported by 
                        DMZ, where I explore how technology can scale human guidance without losing its 
                        personal touch. On the frontend, I work with frameworks like React and Tailwind 
                        CSS to design responsive, minimal user interfaces that feel intuitive and purposeful.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Outside of engineering, I enjoy drawing, producing music, and following European football.
                        I am a huge supporter of Manchester City and Real Madrid.
